                <br/>
                <span id="desc">
                        <p>This past summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at Fidelity Investments. 
                            While working on the Fidelity Brokerage Technology (FBT) team, I got the opportunity to work on FBT's web-based project management tool, iTracker.
                            Much of my work involved automating report generation, which vastly reduced manual data entry. One of the most valuable parts of my internship was
                            working with an offshore team based in Chennai, India &mdash; each member of my immediate team of four made sacrifices to come into work early or stay
                            late to keep working toward the goals we had set for ourselves.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
                            I came into my internship with heavy experience in C++, Java, HTML, and CSS, but I quickly learned that software engineering at a company is as much about
                            your ability to quickly pick up new languages as it is about the languages you already know. As such, I found myself developing major skills in JavaScript, jQuery, 
                            SQL, C#, ASP.NET, XML, and more. Working in such a large company in an industry that demands the most out of its technology taught me real-world lessons
                             that I never could have learned in a classroom.</p>

                <p>Marketing &amp; Sales Intern</p>
                <p id="date">SUMMER 2014 &amp; SUMMER 2015</p>
                <br/>
                <p id="desc">One of my first exposures to the workplace was at Maxwell Health after my sophomore and junior years of high school.
                    When I first started at Maxwell, the company was about 30 employees, so the whole interns-doing-intern-work was thrown out the
                    window. I was helping out wherever I could, doing real, meaningful work for a fast-growing startup. 

                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Working at a startup early in my internship career gave me a fresh perspective on how to apply my skills even at a larger corporation.
                    The culture at Maxwell Health bred innovative thinkers, creative problem-solvers, and risk-takers. I attribute a lot of my accomplishments
                    to learning that way of thinking at such an early age.

                <p id="desc">Being a part of Alpha Kappa Psi, the oldest professional business fraternity at the University of Michigan 
                    has been the most rewarding and enriching experience I've had in my time at college. Not only have I developed important 
                    business skills, but I've also been able to apply my programming experience as Vice President of Operations and a member
                    of the Technology Committee.

                    operations. On Technology Committee, I work on the rush application team, where we have built a native web-based application
                    for prospective rushees to apply to the fraternity. My main role is on the front-end, using ReactJS, AJAX, and a variety of web languages
                    to create a compelling and top-notch UI/UX.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p id="desc">I got my first introduction to technology within an organization as Executive Digital Editor (EDE) of <i>The Phillipian</i>,
                        my high school's newspaper. A journalism nut at heart, I actually began working for the paper as a sportswriter and sports 
                        associate editor, but during my junior year, made the transition to the digital side of the paper. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                    
                        As EDE, I was fully responsible for all digital arms of the paper, including the website, archives site, mobile app, and video and photo sections.
                        During my tenure, I established an official Digital Board of the paper, while also executing a full redesign of <i>The Phillipian's</i> main website.
                        Additionally, I sought to expand readership through a weekly e-newsletter and in the wake of a newly-raised $500,000 endowment, worked with 
                        <i>The Phillipian's</i> Board of Trustees to plan out a digital future for the paper.
