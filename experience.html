                        <p>This past summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at Fidelity Investments. 
                            While working on the Fidelity Brokerage Technology (FBT) team, I got the opportunity to work on FBT's web-based project management tool, iTracker.
                            Much of my work involved automating report generation, which vastly reduced manual data entry. Working in such a large company 
                            in an industry that demands the most out of its technology gave me an inside look at how software engineering works at a major corporation.</p>
